A vast ocean separates the island of Sadelica from the Mainland.  It is rumored to be a rich land, a place of possibility and wealth.  But also, it is a place of danger.  Strange beasts roam the untamed wilderness, terrible storms engulf the sky at a moment's notice, and a chaotic magic permeates the land, a force that can boil a man where he stands, rend flesh to pieces, flatten bones to dust. But it is also a force that can stop tidal waves, heal mortal wounds, and stop time.  It is this magic that has attracted the most curious scholars, the most opportunistic nobles, and greediest of merchants.  They seek a selfish goal: to understand and control this magic.  Their ambitions have driven a mad rush of immigrants and adventurers to Sadelica, people seeking the opportunity for a better life, however risky it might be.

The six of you, however, had no choice in the matter.  Arrested, bound, and gagged, you were all but kidnapped and thrown onto a ship bound for Sadelica.  You have no indication of who did this to you, or why.  Whatever hopes and dreams you had for the Mainland are gone now.  Any new ones will reside on Sadelica.

You stand aboard The Errant Gallows, a relatively small cargo ship whose hold is filled to bursting with large crates of - ostensibly - food and supplies.  The majesty of Sadelica splays out before you, the sun just setting behind the massive mountain in the center.  Some say that mountain is a dormant volcano.  Some even say it's the source of the strange magic in the land.

The journey has been long and harrowing.  Rough seas, spoiled provisions, and rampant sickness have made the relief among the deckhands almost palpable.  The Captain of this vessel, a grump who goes by Argow, has taken it upon himself to blame your group for the difficulties.  He refuses to speak of your circumstances - why you are aboard his ship and who paid him to keep you there.  His dark looks and ominous mutterings about your party and your ill luck have made your travel yet more unpleasant.  It wasn't only him though. The crew looks at you askance, and jumps at so much as a word muttered in their general direction.

The ship hastens towards a the port of Alinea, a strong tail-wind ushering you away from the ocean behind you.  After a matter of minutes, you float beside an empty dock, watching the mooring lines tumble overboard and the gangplank rattle into place.  Abruptly, Captain Argow shivvies you towards it and boots you off his ship.

"That'll be the last time I take the likes of ye for a chip of coppa'."

Alinea is not the largest town nor its port the grandest, but the plethora of large warehouses lining the coast indicate a distinct purpose for the place.  In an untamed land like Sadelica, there is need for hubs like Alinea to house provisions for those who venture further into the less-settled wilderness.  Caravans of wagons wait outside these warehouses, merchants haggling profusely with clipboard-wielding men and woman.  Dockworkers are scattered everywhere, pulling heavy carts, registering vessels, tying knots, and carrying messages.  Crewmen unload massive crates and barrels from their ships' holds.

"Oi," Captain Argow yells at you.  He heaves a sack over the side of the ship.  As it hits the dock it clanks and chinks like there's metal inside.  "I was told to give ya that when we arrived.  I'll be damned if a piece of yer heritage stays on board."

"And I'm supposed to tell you somethin'."  He glances at each of you.  "Who here speaks for your party?"

Argow nods.  "It's a number.  9.  You find it and tell 'em 'Dancing Thieves'."

The Captain shrugs.  "Dunno.  Don't care.  Now off with you.  Yer not gettin' back on my ship, so you best be gone."  He glances at the sack he threw overboard, shivers, and turns away.
