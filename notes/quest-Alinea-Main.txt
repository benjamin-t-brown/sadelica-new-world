A vast ocean separates the island of Sadelica from the Mainland.  It is rumored to be a rich land, a place of possibility and wealth.  But also, it is a place of danger.  Strange beasts roam the untamed wilderness, terrible storms engulf the sky at a moment's notice, and a chaotic magic permeates the land. It is a powerfully destructive one,it can boil a man where he stands, rend flesh to pieces, flatten bones to dust. But it is also a force that can perform miracles.  It can heal mortal wounds, strengthen weak men, and dissipate terrible storms.  It is this magic that has attracted the most curious scholars, the most opportunistic nobles, and greediest of merchants.  They all seek a selfish goal: to understand and control this magic.  Their ambitions have driven a mad rush of immigrants and adventurers to Sadelica, people risking the opportunity for a better life in this untamed, magical land. 

You, however, had no choice in the matter. One day you were going about your daily life on the main land, when you were suddenly abducted by a gang of hooded figures. Arrested, bound, and gagged, you were all but kidnapped and thrown onto a ship.  After it left harbor, it became apparent immediately that your abductors did not join you on this ship, instead paying for your passage, and for the Captain to leave immediately. The ship is The Errant Gallows, a relatively small cargo ship, and the Captain is a man who goes by the name "Argow".

The journey has been long and harrowing.  Rough seas, spoiled provisions, and rampant sickness have made the discontent among the deckhands almost palpable.  Likely because he needs something to point at, Captain Argow has taken it upon himself to blame your group for the difficulties.  Every chance has gotten to disparage you for merely existing, he his taken it.  His dour attitude has only gotten worse over the journey. This is perhaps the reason why he outright refuses to speak of your circumstances - why you are aboard his ship and who paid him to keep you there.  His dark looks and ominous mutterings about your party and your ill luck have made your travel most unpleasant.  It is not only him though. The whole crew looks at you askance, jumping at so much as a word muttered in their general direction.

You look out the bow of the ship and the majesty of Sadelica splays out before you.  The sun is just setting behind the massive mountain in the center; it casts a looming shadow on ocean.  Some say that mountain is a dormant volcano, one that explodes after enough people have settled on it.  Some even say it's the source of the strange magic in the land.  Nobody seems to know for sure, though. The ship hastens towards a the port of Alinea, a strong tail-wind ushering you eagerly onward.

A few minutes later the ship is setting anchor in the dock, deckhands tying mooring lines to poles and yelling obscenities at each other.  The gangplank rattles into place and abruptly Captain Argow is behind you. With great gusto he shivvies you towards it, pushing you across and off his ship.

"That'll be the last time I take the likes of ye for a chip of coppa'."

- (choose response)

"Oi," Captain Argow yells.  He heaves a sack over the side of the ship.  As it hits the dock it clanks and chinks like metal.  "I was told to give ya that when we arrived.  I'll be damned if a piece of yer heritage stays aboard."

"And I'm supposed to tell you somethin'.  It's a number.  9.  Probably means somethin' 'round here."

- (choose explanation)

The Captain shrugs. "Dunno.  Don't care. Not really my problem, is it?  Now off with you.  Yer not gettin' back on my ship, so you best be gone."  He glances at the sack he threw overboard, shivers, and walks off.

You turn towards the town where you've docked: Alinea.  It is not the largest town nor its port the grandest you've seen, but the plethora of large warehouses lining the coast indicate a distinct purpose for the place.  In an untamed land like Sadelica, there is need for hubs like Alinea to house provisions for those who venture further into the less-settled wilderness.  Caravans of wagons wait outside these warehouses, merchants haggling profusely with clipboard-wielding men and woman.  Dockworkers are scattered everywhere, pulling heavy carts, registering vessels, tying knots, and carrying messages.   There are a few other ships in port as well, vessels about the size of Argow's. Crewmen unload massive crates and barrels from their ships' holds, placing them in marked-off areas around the docks.  The whole enterprise seems oddly formal, oddly rehearsed.  

This is why you were abducted?  To be in this town?
