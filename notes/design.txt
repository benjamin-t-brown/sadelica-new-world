# COMBAT & COMBAT STATS

## Combat Stats
Base Stats increase as you level up.

Local Hp - Your hit points per battle
Max Hp - Your total hitpoint pool.  Healing you pulls from this pool.
Basic Str/Mag/Range Damage Mult

Training Stats must have points put into them

Strength - increases melee damage
Knowledge - increases mag
Focus - increases bow accuracy
Mana - increases mana
Speed - increases AP per battle
Armor Proficiency - Allows you to wear better armor
Constitution - gives you bonus hp

## Armors
  - Characters wearing armor are given armor types.  If a character has an armor type, that character
  takes bonus damage from weapons that deal bonus damage to that type (like AoE2)
    - Light armor
    - Heavy armor
    - No armor
    - Shield armor (neither light/nor heavy/nor none)
    - AoE (so that bashing weapons can deal bonus AoE)
    - Phys armor (from melee)
    - Pierce armor (from arrows)
    - Poison armor
    
    # enemy armor
    - Beast armor
    - Magical armor
    - Fiend armor
    - Island armor
    - Fire armor
    - Water armor

## Magic
  - done by holding on to a "wand" in which you can embed stones called Lapis, kinda like materia.

Lapis are different colors and each are like an "ingredient" to give you magic.
Red Lapis gives Fire, Blue gives Water etc, should probably be more creative here but it serves for now.

Note: Healing spells should be limited.  Characters should auto full heal after battles.

A wand has different amounts of slots.  Lapis can be put into the wand to give different spells, like a recipe.
Not every combination is a spell.  Spell books contain these combinations
  - Red + Red + Red gives lvl 3 fire spell
  - Blue + Blue + Blue gives lvl 3 water spell
  - Red + Blue + Black grants gravity spell
  - Red + Red + White = 3x3 Fireball
  - White + White = haste all

Wands require mana to use.  Basic spells do not cost mana? (always want the player to be able to do *something*)
  - Another way to do this is to let players meditate for SP up to a certain value

Characters become more effective with wands by:
  - Increasing/changing combinations of Lapis
  - Increasing their mana to be able to use more spells.
  - Increasing Knowledge to equip better wands
  - Increasing Inundation with a color of Lapis to make it do more damage

### Inundation
  - a Character can increase their inundation level with a specific "color" of Lapis through use of an
  Inundation Stone.  This consumes the Lapis and the Stone, but gives the player +1 inundation level with
  that color. Inundation levels increase the damage dealt by using that color of damage.

## Melee Weapons: edged, slashing, bashing
  - Edged weapons do bonus damage to light-armor
  - Slashing weapons do bonus damage to large enemies
  - Bashing weapons do more damage in an area

Melee weapon abilities:
  Every character wielding a melee weapon has access to all of these abilities.  On use, these go on cooldown.
  - Throw - throw an item from your inventory
  - Sweep - deal damage to all units around you.
  - Lunge - deal damage to unit in front of ch, and the ch behind it in a line.
  - Leap - teleport move to target location
  - Skull crack - hit unit to cause dumbfound
  - Guard - Allows unit to guard in place and use reaction to hit units that come into range.

Characters become more effective with melee weapons by:
  - Finding better weapons and equipping them
  - Increasing Strength to equip better weapons & do more damage
  - Increasing skill in Melee Weapons
  - Finding a trainer to focus in Edged/Slashing/Bashing.  This makes one of your weapon abilities more effective,
    (lower cooldown, more damage, more area)

## Ranged Weapons: Bow
  Every character wielding a bow can fire arrows with different types of effects.  Once used, arrows become 'depleted'
  until next battle.  A character can gather and maintain arrows that they can put in their quiver.  Quivers can
  be upgraded.
  - Slow arrow - makes target have less starting AP
  - Poison arrow - makes target poisoned
  - Heal arrow - heals target
  - Silver arrow - silences target
  - Bomb arrow - deals damage in an area
  - Shield arrow - puts a shield on the ground that prevents zones from spawning
  - Purify arrow - removes a zone from the target tile

Arrows can be combined with Power Stones to make Super arrows, more effective versions of previous ones.
Bows are inaccurate the further away you shoot, up to a max dist.  Focus decreases this

Characters become more effective with bow weapons by:
  - Finding and using better bows
  - Finding and using better arrow types
  - Increasing Focus to make bows more accurate
  - Finding a practice range to hone your skill.
