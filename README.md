## Example Usages:

Typical text adventure games require the player to interact with the game via typing a command, however you can achieve a similar result by constructing the game as a massive dialogue tree.  Players are confronted with a promt and interact with it by pressiong 0-9 which corresponds to their choice.

Some examples.

*Text-based Adventures*
```
> You stand looking over the edge of a cliff, gazing at a swirling mist through which
> you can barely see a light shining in the distance.
> --------
> 1.) [ROPE] Use your rope to descend the cliff face.
> 2.) Attempt to climb down the cliff.
> 3.) Leave.
> --------
```
